## R Markdown

### sub-header

#### another smallers sub header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r Demo Chunk, echo=FALSE}
x = 1 
y = 13
print(x+y)
```

## Inserting Links & Images

[my link](URL)

![my image](path%20to%20image) for example: (img/rmarkdownflow.png) --
with img being an image folder

OR

![my image](URL) - this won't work to knit into pdf, but it will work to
knit to html
